// Task 1: Declare and assign values to "num1" and "num2"
var num1 = 10;
var num2 = 3;

// Task 2: Calculate the sum of "num1" and "num2"
var sum = num1 + num2;

// Task 3: Calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2"
var difference = num1 - num2;

// Task 4: Calculate the product of "num1" and "num2"
var product = num1 * num2;

// Task 5: Calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2"
var quotient = num1 / num2;

// Task 6: Calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2"
var remainder = num1 % num2;

// Task 7: Print the information using console.log()
console.log("The sum is " + sum + ".");
console.log("The difference is " + difference + ".");
console.log("The product is " + product + ".");
console.log("The quotient is " + quotient + ".");
